- this repo contains code and a notebook for that implementation the four case studies in the article "Design of Complex Experiments using Mixed Integer Linear Programming"
- the included `milp` package contains various utility functions for each case study
- a notebook demonstrating the examples from the article can be found in the `notebooks` directory [here](https://github.com/gallantlab/milp_experimental_design/blob/main/notebooks/MILP_for_experimental_design.ipynb)
